# About markless.el
This package implements a major-mode for "Markless"(https://shirakumo.github.io/markless) documents. It performs syntax highlighting, and adds minimal editing support.

Markless.el can be installed from "MELPA"(http://melpa.org/#/getting-started). Once MELPA is set up, you should be able to enter ``M-x package-install markless RET`` to install it. From there on, files with the ``.mess`` ending should be automatically opened in markless-mode.
